### React Components 
 > Re-usable and independent pieces of React code that comprise the User Interface.
### ES6 importing and exporting 
 > A new syntax for sharing code between separate files. Used in cases like `import React from ‘react’`
### State 
> The pertinent data to an application. Each component has its local state as long as you declare add the constructor to a Component and declare its state object.
### Updating State 
> When updating state, make sure to never mutate state directly. Doing so will lead to fatal errors in your application. Instead, re-declare new instances of state arrays or objects and use the setState() function to update state.
### Props 
> Similar to state, except this data inherits from parent component specifying pieces of state as properties.
### LifeCycle Methods 
> Events in React components that trigger in cases such as rendering on or off the screen, or during state updates. One example is the `componentDidMount()` lifeCycle hook.
